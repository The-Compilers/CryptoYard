# Story point rules

When working with [the project](https://github.com/orgs/The-Compilers/projects/4/), one can set
story points per issue.

When estimating story points for issues, one can use the following methodology:

* I know how to do it (have done something similar before) and it can be done in:
    * minutes => 1 point
    * 1 hour => 2 points
    * 2-4 hours => 4 points
    * a day => 8 points
    * 1-2 days => 16 points
* I have not done it before, but I have a fair idea how it could be done, and I think it can be done
  in:
    * 1 hour => 4 points
    * 2-4 hours => 8 points
    * a day => 16 points
    * 1-2 days => 32 points
* I have no idea how to do it, but I know how to start the research, and it looks like something
  that can be done in:
    * 1-4 hours: 12 points
    * a day: 24 points
    * 1-2 days: 40 points
* I have no clue how to attack the problem, and it looks like something that takes:
    * hours: 24 points
    * days: 48 points

Anything that feels larger than 2 days should be broken down into several issues!
