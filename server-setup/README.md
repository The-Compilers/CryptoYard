# Server setup

This is a script to set up all the necessary tools on a "bare" Ubuntu 20.04 server (virtual machine)

To launch the setup:
1. Copy the file to the server, for example with scp; or `nano server-setup.sh` in the console, copy the content of `server-setup.sh` file on your host machine, paste it to the nano editor (right mouse-click).
2. Set the "execute" permission for the script: `chmod a+x server-setup.sh`
3. Execute the script as root: `sudo ./server-setup.sh`
