## Setup

You need to ensure that environmental variable `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` is defined and contains the base URL to the
backend. For example: `http://localhost:8080` or `/api`.

The easiest way to set up the environmental variables is to create file named `.env` in the main folder of the frontend
project.
